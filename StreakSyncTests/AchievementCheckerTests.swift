 * ACHIEVEMENTCHECKERTESTS - ACHIEVEMENT SYSTEM VALIDATION
 * 
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * This file tests the achievement system to make sure it works correctly. It's like a "quality
 * control inspector" that checks if achievements unlock at the right times and with the right
 * conditions. Think of it as automated testing that ensures the achievement system is fair,
 * consistent, and bug-free. It tests specific scenarios like streak milestones and consecutive
 * day tracking to make sure users get the rewards they deserve.
 * 
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 * Testing is crucial for any app feature, especially something as important as achievements.
 * Without tests, bugs in the achievement system could cause users to miss rewards or get
 * achievements they didn't earn. This file ensures that the achievement logic works correctly
 * and that changes to the code don't break existing functionality.
 * 
 * IMPORTANCE TO APPLICATION:
 * - CRITICAL: Ensures the achievement system works correctly and fairly
 * - Validates that achievements unlock at the right milestones
 * - Tests edge cases and boundary conditions
 * - Prevents regressions when code is changed
 * - Provides confidence in the achievement system's reliability
 * - Documents expected behavior through test cases
 * 
 * WHAT IT REFERENCES:
 * - XCTest: iOS testing framework for unit tests
 * - StreakSync: The main app module being tested
 * - AppState: For creating test data and app state
 * - TieredAchievementChecker: The main component being tested
 * - AchievementFactory: For creating test achievements
 * - GameResult, GameStreak: Test data models
 * 
 * WHAT REFERENCES IT:
 * - Xcode: Runs these tests during development and CI/CD
 * - Test runners: Execute these tests to validate the app
 * - Developers: Use these tests to understand expected behavior
 * - CI/CD systems: Run these tests automatically before deployment
 * 
 * CODE IMPROVEMENTS & REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. TEST COVERAGE IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current tests are basic - could be more comprehensive
 *    - Add tests for all achievement types and edge cases
 *    - Test achievement progress tracking and tier upgrades
 *    - Add tests for achievement unlock timing and conditions
 * 
 * 2. TEST DATA IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current test data is minimal - could be more realistic
 *    - Create comprehensive test data sets
 *    - Add helper methods for creating test scenarios
 *    - Implement test data factories for different achievement types
 * 
 * 3. TEST ORGANIZATION:
 *    - The current tests are in one file - could be better organized
 *    - Consider separating into: StreakTests.swift, GameTests.swift, SpeedTests.swift
 *    - Group related tests together
 *    - Add descriptive test names and documentation
 * 
 * 4. ASSERTION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current assertions are basic - could be more specific
 *    - Add more detailed assertions for achievement progress
 *    - Test achievement metadata and unlock timestamps
 *    - Validate achievement tier progression
 * 
 * 5. TESTING STRATEGIES:
 *    - Add property-based testing for achievement logic
 *    - Implement integration tests with real data
 *    - Add performance tests for large datasets
 *    - Test achievement system under stress conditions
 * 
 * 6. DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add detailed documentation for each test
 *    - Document the test scenarios and expected outcomes
 *    - Add examples of how to run and interpret tests
 *    - Create test coverage reports
 * 
 * 7. TESTING TOOLS:
 *    - Consider using additional testing frameworks
 *    - Add mocking for external dependencies
 *    - Implement test data builders
 *    - Add test utilities for common scenarios
 * 
 * 8. CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:
 *    - Add automated test running
 *    - Implement test result reporting
 *    - Add test coverage monitoring
 *    - Set up test failure notifications
 * 
 * LEARNING NOTES FOR BEGINNERS:
 * - Unit testing: Testing individual components in isolation
 * - XCTest: Apple's testing framework for iOS apps
 * - Test cases: Individual test scenarios that validate specific behavior
 * - Assertions: Statements that check if expected conditions are met
 * - Test data: Sample data used to test functionality
 * - Edge cases: Unusual or boundary conditions that might cause problems
 * - Regression testing: Ensuring changes don't break existing functionality
 * - Test coverage: How much of the code is tested by the test suite
