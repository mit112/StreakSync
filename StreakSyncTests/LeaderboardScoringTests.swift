 * LEADERBOARDSCORINGTESTS - COMPREHENSIVE TESTING FOR SOCIAL SCORING LOGIC
 * 
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * This file provides comprehensive unit tests for the leaderboard scoring system,
 * ensuring that different game types are scored correctly and fairly. It's like a
 * "scoring validation system" that verifies the complex scoring logic works correctly
 * for all supported games. Think of it as the "quality assurance tool" that ensures
 * the social features work properly and users get fair, accurate rankings.
 * 
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 * The leaderboard scoring system is complex because different games have different
 * scoring models (lower attempts, lower time, higher scores, etc.). This test file
 * ensures that all these different scoring models work correctly and produce fair,
 * comparable results. Without these tests, scoring bugs could lead to unfair
 * leaderboards and poor user experience.
 * 
 * IMPORTANCE TO APPLICATION:
 * - CRITICAL: This ensures the social features work correctly and fairly
 * - Tests all scoring models: lowerAttempts, lowerTimeSeconds, lowerGuesses, lowerHints, higherIsBetter
 * - Validates that scoring produces fair, comparable results
 * - Ensures leaderboards are accurate and trustworthy
 * - Prevents scoring bugs that could affect user experience
 * - Provides confidence in the social features
 * 
 * WHAT IT REFERENCES:
 * - XCTest: For unit testing framework
 * - StreakSync: The main app module being tested
 * - LeaderboardScoring: The scoring logic being tested
 * - Game: Game models with different scoring types
 * - DailyGameScore: Score data for testing
 * 
 * WHAT REFERENCES IT:
 * - CI/CD pipeline: Runs these tests automatically
 * - Development workflow: Developers run these tests before committing
 * - Quality assurance: Ensures scoring logic works correctly
 * - Social features: Validates that leaderboards work properly
 * 
 * CODE IMPROVEMENTS & REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. TEST COVERAGE IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current tests are good but could be more comprehensive
 *    - Consider adding edge case tests (zero scores, maximum scores, etc.)
 *    - Add tests for score validation and error handling
 *    - Test with different game configurations
 * 
 * 2. TEST DATA IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current test data is good but could be more varied
 *    - Consider adding more realistic test scenarios
 *    - Add tests with different user profiles and score distributions
 *    - Test with historical data patterns
 * 
 * 3. TEST ORGANIZATION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current organization is good but could be more modular
 *    - Consider separating tests by game type or scoring model
 *    - Add helper methods for common test setup
 *    - Implement test data builders for complex scenarios
 * 
 * 4. ASSERTION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current assertions are good but could be more detailed
 *    - Consider adding more specific error messages
 *    - Add assertions for edge cases and boundary conditions
 *    - Test for performance characteristics
 * 
 * 5. TESTING STRATEGIES:
 *    - Add property-based testing for scoring consistency
 *    - Implement integration tests with real data
 *    - Add performance tests for large datasets
 *    - Test with different user scenarios
 * 
 * 6. DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add detailed documentation for test scenarios
 *    - Document the expected behavior for each scoring model
 *    - Add examples of how to add new scoring tests
 *    - Create testing guidelines for scoring logic
 * 
 * 7. TESTING TOOLS:
 *    - Consider adding test coverage reporting
 *    - Implement automated test result analysis
 *    - Add test performance monitoring
 *    - Use test data generation tools
 * 
 * 8. CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:
 *    - Ensure tests run on every commit
 *    - Add test result reporting and notifications
 *    - Implement test failure analysis
 *    - Add test performance monitoring
 * 
 * LEARNING NOTES FOR BEGINNERS:
 * - Unit testing: Testing individual components in isolation
 * - Test-driven development: Writing tests before implementing features
 * - Scoring systems: Converting different game metrics to comparable scores
 * - Social features: Features that involve multiple users and competition
 * - Quality assurance: Ensuring code works correctly and reliably
 * - Test coverage: Measuring how much of the code is tested
 * - Edge cases: Unusual or extreme scenarios that need testing
 * - Assertions: Statements that verify expected behavior
 * - Test data: Data used specifically for testing purposes
 * - Continuous integration: Automatically running tests on code changes
