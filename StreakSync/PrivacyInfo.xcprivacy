 * PRIVACYINFO.XCPRIVACY - APP STORE PRIVACY COMPLIANCE AND TRANSPARENCY
 * 
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * This file provides transparency about how the StreakSync app uses privacy-sensitive
 * APIs and handles user data. It's like a "privacy declaration" that tells users
 * and the App Store exactly what the app does with their data. Think of it as the
 * "privacy transparency document" that ensures the app complies with App Store
 * privacy requirements and builds trust with users.
 * 
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 * Apple requires all apps to declare their use of privacy-sensitive APIs for App Store
 * compliance and user transparency. This file explicitly states that StreakSync does
 * not track users, does not collect personal data, and only uses APIs for legitimate
 * app functionality. It helps users understand what the app does with their data.
 * 
 * IMPORTANCE TO APPLICATION:
 * - CRITICAL: This is required for App Store compliance (iOS 17+)
 * - Ensures transparency about data usage and privacy practices
 * - Declares that the app does not track users or collect personal data
 * - Explains legitimate use of UserNotifications for reminders
 * - Explains legitimate use of AppGroups for Share Extension functionality
 * - Builds user trust through transparency
 * - Prevents App Store review delays due to privacy concerns
 * 
 * WHAT IT REFERENCES:
 * - UserNotifications: For scheduling streak reminders and achievement alerts
 * - AppGroups: For sharing game results between app and Share Extension
 * - Privacy APIs: iOS APIs that require privacy declarations
 * 
 * WHAT REFERENCES IT:
 * - App Store: Reviews this during app submission process
 * - Users: Can view this information in App Store privacy labels
 * - Privacy Review: Apple uses this for privacy compliance verification
 * - App Store Connect: Uses this for privacy label generation
 * 
 * CODE IMPROVEMENTS & REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. PRIVACY TRANSPARENCY IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current declarations are accurate and appropriate
 *    - Consider adding more detailed explanations if new APIs are used
 *    - Add explanations for any future privacy-sensitive features
 *    - Review and update regularly as app features evolve
 * 
 * 2. COMPLIANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current compliance is excellent (no tracking, no data collection)
 *    - Maintain this privacy-first approach as the app grows
 *    - Consider adding privacy impact assessments for new features
 *    - Implement privacy by design principles
 * 
 * 3. DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add detailed documentation for privacy practices
 *    - Document the privacy implications of each API usage
 *    - Add examples of how privacy is protected
 *    - Create privacy guidelines for future development
 * 
 * 4. TESTING IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add tests to verify privacy compliance
 *    - Test that no unexpected data collection occurs
 *    - Test that privacy declarations match actual behavior
 *    - Test privacy settings and user controls
 * 
 * 5. MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY:
 *    - Add logging for privacy-related operations
 *    - Monitor compliance with privacy declarations
 *    - Track privacy-related user feedback
 *    - Monitor App Store privacy review status
 * 
 * LEARNING NOTES FOR BEGINNERS:
 * - Privacy compliance: Following rules and best practices for protecting user data
 * - App Store requirements: Rules that apps must follow to be published
 * - Privacy transparency: Being open about how apps use user data
 * - User trust: Building confidence through honest and transparent practices
 * - Privacy by design: Building privacy protection into apps from the start
 * - Data minimization: Only collecting and using data that's necessary
 * - User consent: Getting permission before using personal data
 * - Privacy labels: Information shown to users about app privacy practices
 * - API declarations: Telling users which privacy-sensitive features an app uses
 * - Compliance: Following legal and platform requirements
