 * STREAKSYNC ENTITLEMENTS - APP SECURITY AND CAPABILITIES CONFIGURATION
 * 
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * This file defines the security entitlements and capabilities that the StreakSync app
 * is allowed to use. It's like a "permission slip" that tells iOS what special features
 * the app can access. Think of it as the "security configuration" that enables the
 * app to use App Groups for sharing data between the main app and the Share Extension.
 * 
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 * iOS requires apps to explicitly declare what special capabilities they need for
 * security and privacy reasons. This file tells iOS that StreakSync needs to use
 * App Groups to share data between the main app and the Share Extension, which is
 * essential for the core functionality of adding game results from other apps.
 * 
 * IMPORTANCE TO APPLICATION:
 * - CRITICAL: This enables the core Share Extension functionality
 * - Defines App Group access for inter-app communication
 * - Enables data sharing between main app and Share Extension
 * - Required for the Share Extension to save game results
 * - Essential for the app's core feature of importing game results
 * - Ensures proper security boundaries and data isolation
 * 
 * WHAT IT REFERENCES:
 * - App Groups: iOS feature for sharing data between app and extensions
 * - group.com.mitsheth.StreakSync: The specific App Group identifier
 * - Share Extension: Uses this App Group to share data with main app
 * 
 * WHAT REFERENCES IT:
 * - iOS System: Uses this to grant the app the specified capabilities
 * - App Store: Reviews this during app submission process
 * - Share Extension: Must have matching entitlements to access the same App Group
 * - AppGroupBridge: Uses the App Group to communicate between app and extension
 * 
 * CODE IMPROVEMENTS & REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current configuration is secure and appropriate
 *    - Consider adding CloudKit entitlements when implementing cloud features
 *    - Add push notification entitlements if needed for future features
 *    - Review entitlements regularly for security best practices
 * 
 * 2. CAPABILITY EXPANSION:
 *    - The current capabilities are minimal and focused
 *    - Consider adding CloudKit entitlements for social features
 *    - Add background processing entitlements if needed
 *    - Add network entitlements for future cloud features
 * 
 * 3. DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add detailed documentation for each entitlement
 *    - Document the purpose and usage of each capability
 *    - Add examples of how entitlements are used
 *    - Create entitlement usage guidelines
 * 
 * 4. TESTING IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add tests to verify entitlements work correctly
 *    - Test App Group access in different scenarios
 *    - Test Share Extension communication
 *    - Test entitlement validation
 * 
 * 5. MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY:
 *    - Add logging for entitlement-related operations
 *    - Monitor App Group access and usage
 *    - Track Share Extension communication success
 *    - Monitor entitlement compliance
 * 
 * LEARNING NOTES FOR BEGINNERS:
 * - Entitlements: Special permissions that apps need to access certain iOS features
 * - App Groups: A way for apps and extensions to share data securely
 * - Security: Protecting user data and app functionality
 * - Privacy: Ensuring user data is handled appropriately
 * - Share Extensions: iOS feature that allows apps to receive content from other apps
 * - Inter-app communication: How different parts of an app talk to each other
 * - iOS security model: How iOS protects user data and app functionality
 * - App Store review: Process where Apple reviews app capabilities and security
 * - Configuration files: Files that define how an app is set up and configured
 * - Capabilities: Special features that apps can request access to
