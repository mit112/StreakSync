 * ANALYTICSSELFTESTS - DEBUG-ONLY ANALYTICS VALIDATION AND TESTING
 * 
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * This file provides lightweight self-tests that validate analytics calculations
 * during development without requiring a separate test target. It's like a
 * "analytics validator" that creates synthetic data and verifies that the
 * analytics system works correctly. Think of it as the "analytics quality
 * assurance tool" that ensures the analytics engine produces accurate results
 * for different scenarios and data patterns.
 * 
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 * Analytics calculations are complex and need to be validated to ensure they
 * produce accurate results. This self-test system allows developers to quickly
 * verify that analytics work correctly during development without setting up
 * a full testing framework. It's particularly useful for catching analytics
 * bugs early in the development process.
 * 
 * IMPORTANCE TO APPLICATION:
 * - CRITICAL: This ensures analytics calculations are accurate and reliable
 * - Validates analytics logic with synthetic test data
 * - Tests different analytics scenarios and edge cases
 * - Provides quick feedback during development
 * - Ensures analytics consistency across different data patterns
 * - Helps catch analytics bugs before they reach users
 * - Supports development workflow with immediate validation
 * 
 * WHAT IT REFERENCES:
 * - Foundation: For basic data types and logging
 * - OSLog: For logging and debugging
 * - AppState: For accessing game data and analytics
 * - AnalyticsService: The analytics system being tested
 * - GameResult: Test data for analytics validation
 * 
 * WHAT REFERENCES IT:
 * - Development workflow: Developers can call this during development
 * - Analytics system: This validates the analytics calculations
 * - Debug builds: This only runs in debug mode for development
 * - Quality assurance: This ensures analytics accuracy
 * 
 * CODE IMPROVEMENTS & REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. TEST COVERAGE IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current tests are good but could be more comprehensive
 *    - Consider adding more test scenarios and edge cases
 *    - Add tests for different game types and scoring models
 *    - Test analytics with various data patterns and volumes
 * 
 * 2. TEST DATA IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current test data is good but could be more varied
 *    - Consider adding more realistic test scenarios
 *    - Add tests with different user behavior patterns
 *    - Test with historical data patterns
 * 
 * 3. TEST ORGANIZATION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current organization is good but could be more modular
 *    - Consider separating tests by analytics type or scenario
 *    - Add helper methods for common test setup
 *    - Implement test data builders for complex scenarios
 * 
 * 4. ASSERTION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current assertions are good but could be more detailed
 *    - Consider adding more specific error messages
 *    - Add assertions for edge cases and boundary conditions
 *    - Test for performance characteristics
 * 
 * 5. TESTING STRATEGIES:
 *    - Add property-based testing for analytics consistency
 *    - Implement integration tests with real data
 *    - Add performance tests for large datasets
 *    - Test with different user scenarios
 * 
 * 6. DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add detailed documentation for test scenarios
 *    - Document the expected behavior for each test
 *    - Add examples of how to add new tests
 *    - Create testing guidelines for analytics
 * 
 * 7. TESTING TOOLS:
 *    - Consider adding test coverage reporting
 *    - Implement automated test result analysis
 *    - Add test performance monitoring
 *    - Use test data generation tools
 * 
 * 8. CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:
 *    - Ensure tests run on every commit
 *    - Add test result reporting and notifications
 *    - Implement test failure analysis
 *    - Add test performance monitoring
 * 
 * LEARNING NOTES FOR BEGINNERS:
 * - Self-tests: Tests that run during development to validate functionality
 * - Analytics validation: Ensuring analytics calculations are correct
 * - Synthetic data: Fake data created specifically for testing
 * - Debug-only code: Code that only runs during development
 * - Quality assurance: Ensuring code works correctly and reliably
 * - Test coverage: Measuring how much of the code is tested
 * - Edge cases: Unusual or extreme scenarios that need testing
 * - Assertions: Statements that verify expected behavior
 * - Test data: Data used specifically for testing purposes
 * - Development workflow: The process of developing and testing code
