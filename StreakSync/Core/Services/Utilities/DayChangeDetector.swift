 * DAYCHANGEDETECTOR - AUTOMATIC DAY TRANSITION MONITORING
 * 
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * This file is the "day change monitor" that automatically detects when the day changes
 * and triggers updates throughout the app. It's like a "smart calendar" that watches
 * for midnight transitions and notifies other parts of the app when a new day begins.
 * Think of it as the "day transition coordinator" that ensures the app stays up-to-date
 * with the current date and triggers any necessary updates when the day changes.
 * 
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 * Many parts of the app need to know when a new day begins - for updating streaks,
 * refreshing daily statistics, and triggering new day notifications. This detector
 * provides a centralized way to monitor day changes and notify all interested parts
 * of the app, ensuring everything stays synchronized with the current date.
 * 
 * IMPORTANCE TO APPLICATION:
 * - CRITICAL: This ensures the app stays current with the actual date
 * - Automatically detects day changes and triggers app updates
 * - Monitors app lifecycle events to catch missed day changes
 * - Provides a centralized notification system for day transitions
 * - Ensures streaks and daily statistics are updated correctly
 * - Handles edge cases like app being closed during midnight
 * - Provides a reliable way to track the current day
 * 
 * WHAT IT REFERENCES:
 * - Timer: For periodic checking of day changes
 * - NotificationCenter: For posting day change notifications
 * - Combine: For reactive programming and app lifecycle monitoring
 * - UIKit: For app lifecycle events and notifications
 * - DateFormatter: For formatting and comparing dates
 * - Published properties: For triggering UI updates
 * 
 * WHAT REFERENCES IT:
 * - AppState: Uses this to update streaks and daily data
 * - NotificationScheduler: Uses this to schedule daily reminders
 * - Analytics: Uses this to update daily statistics
 * - Various views: Can observe day changes for UI updates
 * 
 * CODE IMPROVEMENTS & REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. MONITORING STRATEGY IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current monitoring is basic - could be more sophisticated
 *    - Consider using system-level day change notifications
 *    - Add support for different time zones and locales
 *    - Implement smart monitoring based on user activity
 * 
 * 2. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
 *    - The current timer approach could be optimized
 *    - Consider using more efficient day change detection
 *    - Add support for background day change monitoring
 *    - Implement smart timer management
 * 
 * 3. ERROR HANDLING:
 *    - The current error handling is basic - could be more robust
 *    - Add support for handling time zone changes
 *    - Implement fallback strategies for missed day changes
 *    - Add detailed logging for debugging day change issues
 * 
 * 4. TESTING IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add comprehensive unit tests for day change logic
 *    - Test different time zone and locale scenarios
 *    - Add integration tests with app lifecycle events
 *    - Test edge cases like app being closed during midnight
 * 
 * 5. DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add detailed documentation for day change detection
 *    - Document the notification system and event handling
 *    - Add examples of how to use day change notifications
 *    - Create day change flow diagrams
 * 
 * 6. EXTENSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Make it easier to add new day change listeners
 *    - Add support for custom day change events
 *    - Implement day change plugins
 *    - Add support for different calendar systems
 * 
 * 7. MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY:
 *    - Add detailed logging for day change events
 *    - Implement metrics for day change detection accuracy
 *    - Add support for day change debugging
 *    - Monitor day change notification delivery
 * 
 * 8. USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add support for user-configurable day change behavior
 *    - Implement smart day change notifications
 *    - Add support for different day change preferences
 *    - Consider adding day change celebrations
 * 
 * LEARNING NOTES FOR BEGINNERS:
 * - Day change detection: Monitoring when the date changes
 * - Timers: Scheduled tasks that run at regular intervals
 * - Notifications: Messages sent between different parts of an app
 * - App lifecycle: Events when the app becomes active, goes to background, etc.
 * - Published properties: Values that trigger UI updates when they change
 * - Combine: Apple's framework for reactive programming
 * - Date handling: Working with dates and time in programming
 * - Background processing: Doing work when the app isn't actively being used
 * - Event-driven programming: Responding to events and changes
 * - Centralized monitoring: Having one place that watches for important changes
