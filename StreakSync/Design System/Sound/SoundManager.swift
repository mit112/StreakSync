 * SOUNDMANAGER - AUDIO FEEDBACK AND CELEBRATION SYSTEM
 * 
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * This file provides a centralized system for managing sound effects throughout the app.
 * It's like a "sound effects coordinator" that plays appropriate audio feedback for
 * different user actions and achievements. Think of it as the "audio celebration system"
 * that makes the app feel more engaging and rewarding by providing satisfying sound
 * effects for achievements, progress, and important events.
 * 
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 * Sound effects enhance the user experience by providing audio feedback that makes
 * interactions feel more satisfying and engaging. This manager ensures that all
 * sound effects are consistent, appropriate, and don't overwhelm the user. It
 * provides different types of sounds for different events, making the app feel
 * more polished and rewarding to use.
 * 
 * IMPORTANCE TO APPLICATION:
 * - CRITICAL: This enhances user experience with audio feedback
 * - Provides consistent sound effects across all interactions
 * - Supports different types of sounds for different events
 * - Manages sound queuing and throttling to prevent audio spam
 * - Integrates with user preferences for sound control
 * - Makes achievements and progress feel more rewarding
 * - Provides accessibility benefits for users with visual impairments
 * 
 * WHAT IT REFERENCES:
 * - AVFoundation: Apple's audio framework for sound playback
 * - AVAudioSession: For managing audio session and playback
 * - AVAudioPlayer: For playing sound effects
 * - OSLog: For logging and debugging audio issues
 * - AppStorage: For persisting user sound preferences
 * - SoundType: Enum defining different types of sound effects
 * 
 * WHAT REFERENCES IT:
 * - Achievement system: Uses this to celebrate achievement unlocks
 * - Progress tracking: Uses this to celebrate milestone progress
 * - Game interactions: Uses this to provide audio feedback
 * - Celebration views: Use this to enhance celebrations with sound
 * - Settings: Can configure sound preferences
 * 
 * CODE IMPROVEMENTS & REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. SOUND SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current system is basic - could be more sophisticated
 *    - Consider adding more sound types and variations
 *    - Add support for custom sound files and audio assets
 *    - Implement smart sound selection based on context
 * 
 * 2. AUDIO MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current audio management could be enhanced
 *    - Add support for audio mixing and layering
 *    - Implement smart audio queuing and prioritization
 *    - Add support for audio fade-in/fade-out effects
 * 
 * 3. USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current sound system could be more user-friendly
 *    - Add support for sound customization and preferences
 *    - Implement smart sound recommendations
 *    - Add support for sound tutorials and guidance
 * 
 * 4. ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current accessibility support could be enhanced
 *    - Add support for audio description and narration
 *    - Implement audio accessibility features
 *    - Add support for different accessibility needs
 * 
 * 5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
 *    - The current implementation could be optimized
 *    - Consider implementing efficient audio loading and caching
 *    - Add support for background audio processing
 *    - Implement smart audio resource management
 * 
 * 6. TESTING IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add comprehensive unit tests for sound logic
 *    - Test different sound scenarios and edge cases
 *    - Add integration tests with real audio playback
 *    - Test accessibility features
 * 
 * 7. DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add detailed documentation for sound features
 *    - Document the different sound types and usage patterns
 *    - Add examples of how to use different sounds
 *    - Create sound usage guidelines
 * 
 * 8. EXTENSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Make it easier to add new sound types
 *    - Add support for custom sound configurations
 *    - Implement sound plugins
 *    - Add support for third-party audio integrations
 * 
 * LEARNING NOTES FOR BEGINNERS:
 * - Sound effects: Audio feedback that makes interactions feel more engaging
 * - AVFoundation: Apple's framework for audio and video processing
 * - Audio session: Managing how the app handles audio playback
 * - User experience: Making sure the app feels engaging and rewarding
 * - Accessibility: Ensuring the app works for users with different needs
 * - Audio feedback: Providing users with information through sound
 * - Sound queuing: Managing multiple sounds to prevent audio conflicts
 * - User preferences: Allowing users to customize their experience
 * - Performance: Making sure audio doesn't slow down the app
 * - Design systems: Standardized approaches to creating consistent experiences
