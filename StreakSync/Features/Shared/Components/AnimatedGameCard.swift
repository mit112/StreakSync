 * ANIMATEDGAMECARD - ENGAGING GAME DISPLAY WITH SMOOTH ANIMATIONS
 * 
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * This file provides an animated, interactive card component for displaying individual games
 * with their streaks, progress, and status. It's like a "game showcase card" that presents
 * each game in an attractive, animated format with visual feedback and smooth transitions.
 * Think of it as the "game presentation system" that makes each game look appealing and
 * provides clear visual information about the user's progress and achievements.
 * 
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 * The app needs an attractive way to display games and their associated streaks. This
 * component provides a consistent, animated card format that shows game information,
 * streak data, and completion status in an engaging way. It makes the dashboard feel
 * more dynamic and provides clear visual feedback about the user's gaming progress.
 * 
 * IMPORTANCE TO APPLICATION:
 * - CRITICAL: This is the primary way games are displayed throughout the app
 * - Creates engaging, animated cards for each game
 * - Shows streak information, progress, and completion status
 * - Provides visual feedback with animations and transitions
 * - Uses consistent styling and color theming
 * - Makes the app feel more dynamic and engaging
 * - Provides clear visual hierarchy and information display
 * 
 * WHAT IT REFERENCES:
 * - Game: Core game data model
 * - GameStreak: Streak information and progress data
 * - AppState: For accessing current app state and data
 * - StreakSyncColors: For consistent color theming
 * - SafeSFSymbol: For safe icon display with fallbacks
 * - AnimatedStreakStat: For displaying streak statistics
 * - GlassEffect: For modern glassmorphism styling
 * 
 * WHAT REFERENCES IT:
 * - Dashboard views: Use this to display games in the main interface
 * - Game list views: Use this to show games in various contexts
 * - Search results: Use this to display matching games
 * - Category views: Use this to show games by category
 * - Various feature views: Use this for consistent game display
 * 
 * CODE IMPROVEMENTS & REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. CARD DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current design is good but could be more sophisticated
 *    - Consider adding more card variations and layouts
 *    - Add support for custom card configurations
 *    - Implement smart card layout selection based on content
 * 
 * 2. ANIMATION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current animations are good but could be enhanced
 *    - Consider adding more sophisticated animation effects
 *    - Add support for custom animation configurations
 *    - Implement smart animation selection based on context
 * 
 * 3. INFORMATION DISPLAY IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current information display could be enhanced
 *    - Add support for more detailed game information
 *    - Implement smart information prioritization
 *    - Add support for customizable information display
 * 
 * 4. ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current accessibility support could be enhanced
 *    - Add better VoiceOver navigation and descriptions
 *    - Implement accessibility shortcuts
 *    - Add support for different accessibility needs
 * 
 * 5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
 *    - The current implementation could be optimized
 *    - Consider implementing efficient card rendering
 *    - Add support for card caching and reuse
 *    - Implement smart card management
 * 
 * 6. USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current card system could be more user-friendly
 *    - Add support for card customization and preferences
 *    - Implement smart card recommendations
 *    - Add support for card tutorials and guidance
 * 
 * 7. TESTING IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add comprehensive unit tests for card logic
 *    - Test different card configurations and scenarios
 *    - Add UI tests for card interactions
 *    - Test accessibility features
 * 
 * 8. DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add detailed documentation for card features
 *    - Document the different card types and usage patterns
 *    - Add examples of how to use different cards
 *    - Create card usage guidelines
 * 
 * LEARNING NOTES FOR BEGINNERS:
 * - Card components: UI elements that display information in a contained format
 * - Animations: Visual effects that make interactions feel smooth and engaging
 * - Visual hierarchy: Organizing information to guide user attention
 * - Color theming: Using consistent colors throughout the app
 * - Data binding: Connecting UI components to data sources
 * - Component composition: Building complex UI from simpler components
 * - User experience: Making sure the interface is engaging and informative
 * - Accessibility: Making sure cards work for users with different needs
 * - Performance: Making sure cards render efficiently
 * - Design systems: Standardized approaches to creating consistent experiences
