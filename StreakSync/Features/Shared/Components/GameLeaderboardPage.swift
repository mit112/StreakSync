 * GAMELEADERBOARDPAGE - COMPETITIVE GAME RANKING AND SOCIAL DISPLAY
 * 
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * This file provides a comprehensive leaderboard interface that displays competitive
 * rankings for specific games, showing user positions, scores, and rank changes.
 * It's like a "competitive scoreboard" that creates social engagement and friendly
 * competition among friends. Think of it as the "game ranking system" that makes
 * gaming more social and engaging by showing how users compare to their friends
 * and tracking their progress over time.
 * 
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 * Social competition is a key driver of user engagement in gaming apps. This component
 * provides a clear, engaging way to display competitive rankings, making users more
 * likely to continue playing and improving their scores. It creates a sense of
 * community and friendly competition that encourages regular app usage and
 * achievement pursuit.
 * 
 * IMPORTANCE TO APPLICATION:
 * - CRITICAL: This drives user engagement through social competition
 * - Creates an engaging competitive interface for game rankings
 * - Shows user positions, scores, and rank changes over time
 * - Provides visual feedback for rank improvements and declines
 * - Supports friend management and social features
 * - Makes gaming more social and community-driven
 * - Encourages continued app usage and achievement pursuit
 * 
 * WHAT IT REFERENCES:
 * - Game: Core game data model
 * - LeaderboardRow: Individual leaderboard entry data
 * - GradientAvatar: For displaying user avatars
 * - SwiftUI: For UI components and layout
 * - LazyVStack: For efficient list rendering
 * - Accessibility: For inclusive design
 * 
 * WHAT REFERENCES IT:
 * - Friends views: Use this to display competitive rankings
 * - Game detail views: Use this to show game-specific leaderboards
 * - Social features: Use this for competitive elements
 * - Achievement views: Use this to show competitive achievements
 * 
 * CODE IMPROVEMENTS & REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. LEADERBOARD IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current leaderboard is good but could be more sophisticated
 *    - Consider adding more ranking metrics and variations
 *    - Add support for different leaderboard types and time periods
 *    - Implement smart leaderboard recommendations
 * 
 * 2. SOCIAL FEATURES IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current social features could be enhanced
 *    - Add support for more social interactions and features
 *    - Implement smart social recommendations
 *    - Add support for social tutorials and guidance
 * 
 * 3. ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current accessibility support could be enhanced
 *    - Add better VoiceOver navigation and descriptions
 *    - Implement accessibility shortcuts
 *    - Add support for different accessibility needs
 * 
 * 4. VISUAL DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current visual design could be enhanced
 *    - Add support for more sophisticated visual elements
 *    - Implement smart visual adaptation for different contexts
 *    - Add support for dynamic visual elements
 * 
 * 5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
 *    - The current implementation could be optimized
 *    - Consider implementing efficient leaderboard rendering
 *    - Add support for leaderboard caching and reuse
 *    - Implement smart leaderboard management
 * 
 * 6. USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current leaderboard could be more user-friendly
 *    - Add support for leaderboard customization and preferences
 *    - Implement smart leaderboard recommendations
 *    - Add support for leaderboard tutorials and guidance
 * 
 * 7. TESTING IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add comprehensive unit tests for leaderboard logic
 *    - Test different leaderboard scenarios and configurations
 *    - Add UI tests for leaderboard interactions
 *    - Test accessibility features
 * 
 * 8. DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add detailed documentation for leaderboard features
 *    - Document the different leaderboard types and usage patterns
 *    - Add examples of how to use different leaderboards
 *    - Create leaderboard usage guidelines
 * 
 * LEARNING NOTES FOR BEGINNERS:
 * - Leaderboards: Competitive ranking systems that show user positions
 * - Social features: Features that encourage user interaction and competition
 * - User engagement: Keeping users interested and active in the app
 * - Competitive elements: Features that create friendly competition
 * - Visual feedback: Providing users with information about their performance
 * - Accessibility: Making sure leaderboards work for all users
 * - User experience: Making sure competitive features are engaging and fair
 * - Performance: Making sure leaderboards render efficiently
 * - Component libraries: Collections of reusable UI components
 * - Design systems: Standardized approaches to creating consistent experiences
