 * GAMEDETAILVIEW - INDIVIDUAL GAME DEEP DIVE AND MANAGEMENT
 * 
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * This file creates the detailed view for individual games, showing all the important information
 * about a specific game like Wordle or Quordle. It's like the "game profile page" that displays
 * the user's streak, recent results, performance statistics, and provides quick actions to play
 * the game or add new results. Think of it as the "game dashboard" that gives users a complete
 * overview of their progress and performance for that specific game.
 * 
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 * Users need a detailed view to see their progress and performance for each individual game.
 * This view provides all the relevant information in one place, making it easy to understand
 * how they're doing and what actions they can take. It also handles the complexity of different
 * iOS versions, providing enhanced features for newer iOS versions while maintaining compatibility
 * with older versions.
 * 
 * IMPORTANCE TO APPLICATION:
 * - CRITICAL: This provides the detailed game view that users interact with most
 * - Shows comprehensive game statistics and performance data
 * - Provides quick actions for playing games and adding results
 * - Displays recent results and streak information
 * - Handles different iOS versions with appropriate features
 * - Integrates with the browser launcher for playing games
 * - Supports manual entry and share sheet functionality
 * 
 * WHAT IT REFERENCES:
 * - GameDetailViewModel: Manages the data and business logic for this view
 * - Game: The specific game being displayed
 * - AppState: Access to game data, results, and streaks
 * - NavigationCoordinator: For navigating to other screens
 * - ThemeManager: For consistent styling and theming
 * - BrowserLauncher: For opening games in the browser
 * - Various game detail components: Header, actions, performance, results
 * 
 * WHAT REFERENCES IT:
 * - MainTabView: Can navigate to this view from the dashboard
 * - NavigationCoordinator: Manages navigation to this view
 * - Game cards: Can navigate to this view when tapped
 * - Deep links: Can navigate directly to this view
 * 
 * CODE IMPROVEMENTS & REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. VIEW SIZE REDUCTION:
 *    - This file is large (400+ lines) - should be split into smaller components
 *    - Consider separating into: GameDetailHeader, GameDetailActions, GameDetailContent
 *    - Move iOS version-specific code to separate files
 *    - Create reusable game detail components
 * 
 * 2. STATE MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current state management is complex - could be simplified
 *    - Consider using a state machine for complex loading states
 *    - Add support for optimistic updates for better user experience
 *    - Implement proper state validation and error handling
 * 
 * 3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
 *    - The current implementation could be optimized
 *    - Consider lazy loading for large result sets
 *    - Add view recycling for better memory management
 *    - Implement efficient data fetching and caching
 * 
 * 4. USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current interface could be more intuitive
 *    - Add support for different display modes and layouts
 *    - Implement smart defaults based on user behavior
 *    - Add support for customization and personalization
 * 
 * 5. ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current accessibility support could be enhanced
 *    - Add better VoiceOver navigation
 *    - Implement accessibility shortcuts
 *    - Add support for different accessibility needs
 * 
 * 6. TESTING IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add comprehensive unit tests for game detail logic
 *    - Test different game types and data scenarios
 *    - Add UI tests for game detail interactions
 *    - Test accessibility features
 * 
 * 7. DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add detailed documentation for game detail features
 *    - Document the data flow and component relationships
 *    - Add examples of how to use different features
 *    - Create game detail flow diagrams
 * 
 * 8. EXTENSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Make it easier to add new game types
 *    - Add support for custom game detail layouts
 *    - Implement game detail plugins
 *    - Add support for third-party game integrations
 * 
 * LEARNING NOTES FOR BEGINNERS:
 * - Detail views: Screens that show detailed information about a specific item
 * - View models: Bridge between UI and business logic
 * - State management: Keeping track of what the UI should show
 * - iOS version compatibility: Making sure the app works on different iOS versions
 * - Navigation: Moving between different screens in the app
 * - Data binding: Connecting UI elements to data that can change
 * - Async/await: Handling operations that take time to complete
 * - Error handling: What to do when something goes wrong
 * - Accessibility: Making sure the app is usable for everyone
 * - Performance: Making sure the app runs smoothly with lots of data
