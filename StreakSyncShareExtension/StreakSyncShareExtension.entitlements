 * STREAKSYNCSHAREEXTENSION ENTITLEMENTS - SHARE EXTENSION SECURITY CONFIGURATION
 * 
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * This file defines the security entitlements for the StreakSync Share Extension,
 * enabling it to share data with the main app through App Groups. It's like a
 * "permission slip" specifically for the Share Extension that allows it to access
 * the same shared storage as the main app. Think of it as the "extension security
 * configuration" that enables the Share Extension to save game results that the
 * main app can then access and process.
 * 
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 * Share Extensions run in a separate process from the main app and need explicit
 * permissions to access shared resources. This file tells iOS that the Share
 * Extension is allowed to use the same App Group as the main app, which is
 * essential for the core functionality of importing game results from other apps.
 * 
 * IMPORTANCE TO APPLICATION:
 * - CRITICAL: This enables the Share Extension to communicate with the main app
 * - Defines App Group access for the Share Extension
 * - Enables the Share Extension to save game results to shared storage
 * - Required for the core feature of importing game results from other apps
 * - Essential for the Share Extension to function properly
 * - Ensures proper security boundaries between app and extension
 * 
 * WHAT IT REFERENCES:
 * - App Groups: iOS feature for sharing data between app and extensions
 * - group.com.mitsheth.StreakSync: The specific App Group identifier (must match main app)
 * - Share Extension: Uses this App Group to share data with main app
 * 
 * WHAT REFERENCES IT:
 * - iOS System: Uses this to grant the Share Extension the specified capabilities
 * - App Store: Reviews this during app submission process
 * - Main App: Must have matching entitlements to access the same App Group
 * - ShareViewController: Uses the App Group to save game results
 * 
 * CODE IMPROVEMENTS & REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - The current configuration is secure and appropriate
 *    - Consider adding additional entitlements if Share Extension features expand
 *    - Review entitlements regularly for security best practices
 *    - Ensure entitlements match between main app and extension
 * 
 * 2. CAPABILITY EXPANSION:
 *    - The current capabilities are minimal and focused
 *    - Consider adding network entitlements if Share Extension needs internet access
 *    - Add background processing entitlements if needed
 *    - Add additional App Group entitlements if needed
 * 
 * 3. DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add detailed documentation for each entitlement
 *    - Document the purpose and usage of each capability
 *    - Add examples of how entitlements are used
 *    - Create entitlement usage guidelines
 * 
 * 4. TESTING IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Add tests to verify entitlements work correctly
 *    - Test App Group access in Share Extension scenarios
 *    - Test communication between main app and extension
 *    - Test entitlement validation
 * 
 * 5. MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY:
 *    - Add logging for entitlement-related operations
 *    - Monitor App Group access and usage
 *    - Track Share Extension communication success
 *    - Monitor entitlement compliance
 * 
 * LEARNING NOTES FOR BEGINNERS:
 * - Share Extensions: iOS feature that allows apps to receive content from other apps
 * - Entitlements: Special permissions that apps need to access certain iOS features
 * - App Groups: A way for apps and extensions to share data securely
 * - Security: Protecting user data and app functionality
 * - Privacy: Ensuring user data is handled appropriately
 * - Inter-app communication: How different parts of an app talk to each other
 * - iOS security model: How iOS protects user data and app functionality
 * - App Store review: Process where Apple reviews app capabilities and security
 * - Configuration files: Files that define how an app is set up and configured
 * - Capabilities: Special features that apps can request access to
