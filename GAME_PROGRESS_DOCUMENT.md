## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Parser Pattern
Each game follows this implementation pattern:
1. **Research**: Understand the game's result sharing format
2. **Parser Development**: Create regex-based parser in GameResultParser.swift
3. **Game Model**: Add game definition to SharedModels.swift
4. **Testing**: Validate with various result format examples
5. **Integration**: Update game catalogs and UI components

### Current Parser Architecture
- **Location**: `StreakSync/Core/Models/Game/GameResultParser.swift`
- **Pattern**: Switch statement with game-specific parsing functions
- **Error Handling**: ParsingError enum with localized descriptions
- **Data Structure**: GameResult with parsedData dictionary for game-specific metadata

### Manual Entry System
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Features**: Simple toggle for completion, photo upload for verification
- **Coverage**: Works for ALL games immediately
- **Priority**: Maintain as fallback for all games

### Share Extension System
- **Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented
- **Supported Games**: Pips, Quordle, Wordle, Nerdle, Connections, NYT Strands, Octordle, LinkedIn Queens, LinkedIn Tango, LinkedIn Crossclimb, LinkedIn Pinpoint, LinkedIn Zip, LinkedIn Mini Sudoku (13/13 games)
- **Features**: 
  - Complete game parser support matching main app
  - Key-based queue system for multiple results
  - Immediate result saving (no data loss)
  - Comprehensive debug logging
  - Robust error handling and cleanup
  - LinkedIn games integration with flexible parsing
  - **LinkedIn Zip**: Full time-based scoring and backtrack tracking support
  - **LinkedIn Pinpoint**: Guess-based scoring with proper completion detection (100% match or 📌 emoji)
- **Architecture**: 
  - ShareViewController with individual game parsers
  - AppGroupDataManager with queue processing
  - Unique key system prevents overwriting
  - Automatic queue processing when app becomes active
  - **Game-specific validation**: Supports standard, time-based, and guess-based scoring systems

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Octordle Testing
- **Test manual entry with both formats**:
  - Format 1: With "Score: XX" line
  - Format 2: Emoji grid only (parser calculates score)
- **Verify display format**: Shows single score (e.g., "63") not "63/63"
- **Test validation edge cases**: Score = 0 when Score line missing
- **Verify game availability**: Octordle appears in manual entry game selection
- **Test completion detection**: Failed words (🟥) mark as incomplete

### General Game Testing
- **Test all supported games** in both manual entry and share extension
- **Verify game-specific display logic** for different scoring systems
- **Test validation with edge cases** for each game type
- **Ensure all implemented games** appear in manual entry game selection
- **Test complete user flows** from entry to display
